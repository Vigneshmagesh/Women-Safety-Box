# Women-Safety-Box
# Description
The Women Safety Box project is a mobile application designed to provide a reliable safety solution for women in emergency situations. With the "Shake for Emergency" feature, women can quickly and discreetly alert their dear ones or trusted individuals when they find themselves in distress or danger.
In the event of an emergency, the user can initiate the alert simply by vigorously shaking their phone. This action triggers an immediate response from the Women Safety Box application, ensuring that help is on the way. The application generates an emergency alert message containing vital information such as the user's name and current location. This information is crucial for emergency contacts to accurately assess the situation and provide timely assistance.
